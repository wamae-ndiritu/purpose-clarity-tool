            The purpose clarity tool is meant to guide you on the journey of
            clarifying your purpose.It is possible that you may not clarify your
            purpose on a single sitting.
            <br />
            You must keep refining your responses and your purpose will be
            clearer with time.True purpose is believed to be clarified through
            continuous experimentations
            <br /> with jobs or assignments rather than just thinking. The PCT
            is grounded for example question 1 and 2 ensure that your purpose is
            entrenched in reality not just
            <br /> fancy-desires,imaginations or high-sounding statements.If you
            have already clarified your purpose,there two things you can
            do.(1)you can move straight into
            <br /> writing my purpose story and (2) you can examine your purpose
            against the 7Qs to establish it's completeness
