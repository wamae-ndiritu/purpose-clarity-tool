          Purpose is clarified when something in you meets with something in the
          world that triggers you to take action. This question is meant to
          bring out something in you. This question aims at two key aspects: (1)
          what resources do you have for your lifeâ€™s assignment? The resources
          are not material or physical but natural abilities (unique strengths),
          learned abilities, values, and experiences. (2) Why you and not
          someone else should be the bearer of the particular purpose?
          Clarifying your purpose starts with clarifying who you are. Knowing
          yourself is imperative in clarifying your purpose.
